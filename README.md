# To Run
`./server/serve.sh` - this builds `./server/lib.wasm` and serves the html at `localhost:8080`

After serving the html, you can rebuild using `./build.sh`

# Notes
Currently just has `/pokemon/{id}` routes, the home page just loads bulbasaur.

Also, there is a sleep statement in the pokemon api to test loading icons.
